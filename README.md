# DiscoTurtle


What's better than a turtle at a disco? Jk, this is a minecraft quarry script for CC. 

In the turtle UI: `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickheyer/DiscoTurtle/refs/heads/main/quarry.lua`

Can adjust script as needed but by default it's a 3-layer mining pattern. Coal is slot 1. Will consume fuel as it gets it.
